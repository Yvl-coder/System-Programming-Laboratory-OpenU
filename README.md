The folder "The Project" contains the final project of the course, which named "mmn 14". The review of the project is written in the recommendation letter from my lecturer Yehudit (Judy), "Recommendation Letter - Yehudit (Judy).pdf". </br>
The folder "Tasks" contains the tasks (=mmn's) of the course. </br>
The exam wasnt given to us. We only got the grade of it. </br>
"mmn" means task that contains exercises.
